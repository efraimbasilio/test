Things that i learned in GIT.
1. it makes a developer saved project online.
2. beacause of the repository that is created , all of developers can easily access and commit all their task (code) realtime and because of that the development can be more faster and convinient for the developers. 
3. and also because of GIT it gives the developer a online resume for their future jobs..
